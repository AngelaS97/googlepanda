Brief overview of what is google panda :

Google Panda was developed and introduced by Navneet Panda, a Google engineer. 
It is an alteration to Google's Search Results Ranking Algorithm.
It aimed at lowering the rank of "low Quality sites" or "thin sites" and return higher-quality sites first on the search results pages.It is meant to stop sites with poor quality content from working their way into Google’s top search results.Panda is updated from time-to-time. When this happens, sites previously hit may escape, if they’ve made the right changes. 
A statement made by Google’s PR team about making Panda Google’s core ranking algorithm is as follows:
"Panda is an algorithm that’s applied to sites overall and has become one of our core ranking signals. It measures the quality of a site, which you can read more about in our guidelines. Panda allows Google to take quality into account and adjust ranking accordingly."
